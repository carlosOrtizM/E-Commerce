# E-Commerce
YES. ANOTHER E-COMMERCE CRUD :)

Spring Boot
PostgreSQL
2024

3 Entities (&& corresponding DTOs) 
-Users
-Products
-Orders

Attempting a Hexagonal architecture.

For each Entity weÂ´ve got:
JPA Repositories
Controllers (RESTful!?)
Services

Generic CRUD Interface that is implementented by all services.
Users has a dependency injection (instead of longer service) that validates username & password.

Also contains:
DB Model
Data.sql (Tables Initializer)
